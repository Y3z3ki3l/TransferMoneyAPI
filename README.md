# TransferMoneyAPI
API to perform money transaction between two accounts

### Getting Started

```
This is an API for transfer money between two accounts. 
It's a Restful API and it's based on MVC design pattern 
and implements DAO layer approach for a better integration 
and best practice coding.
```

### Prerequisites

This API works with mongoose to persist data on a local database. So you must setting up a local MongoDB database.

```
The database name has to be: transfermoney-app-db.
```

Collections:
* accounts
* transactions

Note: All collections will be generated automatically by mongoose driver once an account and transaction was created.

### Running

For launch app just execute node following node command:

```    
~./TransferMoneyAPI$ node app.js
```
```
Once the app is running, for Swagger launch and get access for all end-points, 
copy and paste next url en your browser:

http://localhost:3000/api/#/

As first step, you must go to: 
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/post_api_account_create 

To create the two accounts that will be 
used for transfer money (mongoose driver just take
control over collections creation).

To get Account balance:
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/get_api_account__accountNumber__getBalance

To transfer money:
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/post_api_transaction_create

To get all Account's transactions:
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/get_api_transaction__accountNumber__getAllByAccount

To get all Account's sent transacions:
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/get_api_transaction__accountNumber__getSentByAccount

To get all Account's received transcations:
http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/get_api_transaction__accountNumber__getReceivedByAccount
```
Note: As you can see, the app is running locally
